#### _A roman numberal converter and cryptosquare encoder_

#### By _**Brandon B. & Renee Sarley.**_

## Description

_Epicodus' assignment to convert normal numbers to roman numerals with attention to behavior-driven development. Should take in user's input and return it properly reformatted._

## Rules
* _The program will take a numerical value less than 4 and multiply it by 'I'._
* _If there are four I's_
* _if the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!_
* _for words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant._

## Expected Behaviors

|Behavior  |     Input     | Output|
|:----------:|:-------------:|:------:|
| Converts 1's to I | 3 | III |
| Converts 10's to X | 30  | XXX |
| Converts 100's to C  | 300 | CCC |
| Convert 1000's to M | 3000 | MMM |
| If user inputs an exact roman number (1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000), only output corresponding roman numeral | 50 | L |
| If there are 5 in a row of the same, ie. 5, 50, 500, convert to corresponding roman numberal | XXXXX | L |
| If there are more than three of the same, convert to one greater, but keep one in the front. | 4 | IV |
